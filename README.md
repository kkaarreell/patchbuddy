"Summary of Code Changes:
The commit introduces a modification in the `newa/__init__.py` file, specifically in the `Request` class. The change involves how environment variables are handled when generating the command for a request. Previously, all environment variables were appended to the command directly. Now, if an environment variable starts with 'TMT_', it is stored in the `environment` dictionary instead. All other environment variables are still appended to the command as before.

Assessment of Code Quality and Suggestions for Improvement:
The changes made in this commit seem to be well-documented, with a clear commit message and a concise diff. The logic for handling 'TMT_' variables is straightforward and easy to understand. However, there are a few areas that could be improved:

1. The code could benefit from a more explicit check for 'TMT_' variables to avoid potential typos. For example, using a constant or an enumeration for 'TMT_' prefixes could make the code more robust.

2. The commit does not include any tests to verify the new behavior. It would be beneficial to add tests to ensure that 'TMT_' variables are correctly handled and that non-'TMT_' variables are still appended to the command as expected.

3. The commit message could be more descriptive, detailing the rationale behind the change and any potential impacts on existing functionality.

Code Quality Rating (1-5): 2

The code quality is rated as a 2, which is relatively good. The changes are well-structured and easy to understand. However, there is room for improvement in terms of robustness, testing, and documentation."

"markdown
Update the way TMT_ variables are handled in the `Request` class of the `newa` module. Now, TMT_ variables are explicitly passed to the tmt command itself, while non-TMT_ variables are processed as before.
